  In computer text processing, a markup language is a
   system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.[1] The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.[citation needed] In digital media, this "blue pencil instruction text" was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or "instruction
  text encapsulated by tags." However the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or the beginning of a paragraph etc.). Every tag used in a Markup language has a property to format the text we write.
  Examples include typesetting instructions such as those found in troff,
  TeX and LaTeX, or structural markers such as XML tags. Markup instructs the software that displays the text to carry out appropriate actions, but is omitted from the version of the text that users see.

Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics—meaning that their specification prescribes how to present the structured data. Others, such as XML, do not have them and are general purpose.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target = "_blank" title = "html5 specification">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a>, one of the document formats of the World Wide Web, is an instance of Standard Generalized Markup Language or SGML, and follows many of the markup conventions used in the publishing industry in the communication of printed work between authors, editors, and printers.[citation needed]
